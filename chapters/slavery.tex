\subsubsection{Vonir Accord}
\label{sec:Vonir Accord}

The \emph{Vonir Accord}, named after king Sigmund Vonirson of Norbury, is a
treaty signed by almost all major city kingdoms and most bigger baronies of
the north. In exchange for immunity to enslavement of the signing parties'
citizens, all Norbury slaves found on foreign soil must be returned to
Norbury. Further all signing parties must acknowledge the owner's claim over
his slave and not interfere with his rights to his property. This treaty
also allows members of the \nameref{sec:Hunters Guild} to search for, and
apprehend escaped slaves on the land of signing parties.
