\subsection*{Helmarnock}

The city kingdom of \emph{Helmarnock} (old high Teranim for ``land of the
people called Helm'') lies on the south-eastern edge of \emph{Eilean Mor}. It
is unique as the kingdom is resides on four islands, which were once ruled by
separate baronies that joined together into one kingdom.

\subsubsection*{Geography}

Helmarnock lies spread out on four different islands off the south eastern
shore of \emph{Eilean Mor}. The islands are joined together by four huge
stone bridges, that converge in a crossroad in the middle of the sea between
the islands. The kingdom also owns land on the shores of \emph{Eilean Mor}.
The northern island is called \emph{Temen}, the eastern island \emph{Thorm},
the southern island \emph{Eledis} and the western island is called
\emph{Saremen}.

All of the islands are covered with city, and the islands are surrounded by
huge harbours and ports. The land on the shore is mainly used as farmland as
the huge stream \emph{Dunast} makes the land fertile for crops.

\subsubsection*{History}

The city kingdom was founded in \emph{GT:8992} when the four baronies that
ruled the islands and the shore joined together to form one big city kingdom.
The rulers of these baronies all intermarried and created a new noble family
called house \emph{Helm}. The islands were joined with bridges and a small
public forum was built in the centre of this island from which the king could
rule. However in \emph{GT:14388} the noble family ended up without an heir and
the throne became vacant.

For two hundred years the five noble families fought between each over the
throne. Although the conflict never escalated into full civil war, the houses
raided each other, abducted and assassinated important members of other
houses, as well as sabotaged companies and production facilities. These two
hundred years are now known as the \emph{bloody years}, and it deeply
entrenched itself within the population, splitting them into five major
factions. The deep trenches that divided the people of these islands then can
still be felt thousands of years.

Finally in \emph{GT:14590} the dispute was settled. The noble houses decided
to not elect a new ruler, but instead rule the kingdom as a council of family
leaders. But stability and security returned slowly to the city kingdom over
the course of many decades.

\subsubsection*{Culture}

The citizen of Helmarnock are known to still harbour resentment for each other,
and are mostly patriotic towards their own noble family. Years of underhanded
and illegal dealings, corruption within the city guard and armies have given
the people of Helmarnock a reputation for cutting corners, being sleazy,
lacking in morals or being outright criminals. Although this does not hold
true for the vast amount of the working population; the climate of harsh
competition between the islands tends to promote ruthless and underhanded
business tactics amongst the nobility and upper class citizens.

\subsubsection*{House Eseriel of Tenem}

The northern island is ruled by the dark elven noble House of \emph{Eseriel}.
Their banner is a red dragon upon a white background. They operate a large
shipping enterprise and are mostly responsible for imports and exports of
the kingdom. Being natural traders and business men, House \emph{Eseriel}
is the richest among the noble houses.

\subsubsection*{House Onariel of Thorm}

To the east reigns the high elven noble house of \emph{Onariel}. Their main
business is information and espionage, as well as offering counter espionage
to the entire kingdom. Their are infamous and notorious for their criminal
activities, such as smuggling, drug trafficking, espionage and oppression
of enemies of the kingdom. The bad reputation the kingdom and its citizen
have, mostly stems from various scandals that have been uncovered in which
House Onariel was involved.

\subsubsection*{Kelemor of Eledis}

To the south rules the dwarven noble family of \emph{Kelemor}. They once
hailed from the great divide, but made their riches by building most of
the city's buildings and bridges. They operate most of the smithies and
artisan guilds of the kingdom, and often work together with House
\emph{Eseriel} to export their manufactured goods to other kingdoms.
They also provide the equipment to the joint army of Helmarnock. Kelemor
are often the first to call out other houses for breaking the peace or
for attempting to sabotage the finely tuned political machinery that
runs the kingdom. Although Kelemor is a voice for order and piece within
the kingdom, they are also the fiercest proponent for continuing slavery
within the kingdom.

\subsubsection*{House de\'Var of Saremen}

The western island is ruled by the House of \emph{de\'Var}, whose mainstay
members are vampires made up from various races of \emph{Aror}. Even though
vampires generally pose a threat to the general populace, House \emph{de\'Var}
had to sign a treaty during the foundation of the kingdom to not harm any of
the kingdom's citizen, or citizens of their allied city kingdoms. Although
the idea of being ruled by vampires is scary to outsiders, House \emph{de\'Var}
are fair and just rulers. Their members abide by the law, and do not feats on
humanoids, instead preferring to live off \emph{Ramesk}, a mineral rich fluid
invented by the Ilians as a blood substitute. The liquid also allows the
vampires of House \emph{de'Var} to endure the sunlight for a limited amount of
time. The house also provides the city guard for the entire kingdom, and is
paid for this service by the other houses. The island of Saremen also houses
the kingdom's library and arcane institution. Despite having an obvious reason
to be for slavery, house \emph{de\'Var} is openly against it. They do not
require slaves for nourishment, and even if they were to feast upon them,
they'd lose both respect and renown within the very population they try to
rule. The vampires of the house see themselves as superior rulers, since they
do not tire, or die, and wish to proof that very fact to their subjects.

House \emph{de\'Var} was also responsible for creating the race \emph{Umgeher}
in \emph{GT:11800}. In their hubris they attempted to create the perfect
``undead citizen''. Those were supposed to be used as soldiers, guards,
workers and labourers. However the \emph{Umgeher} were poorly received by the
population. Mostly because deceased citizens were used in the process, and
many found their deceased loved ones among the new workforce. And also many
workers feared that the undead would replace them, stripping them of their
lively hood and ability to feed their own families. The people of Saremen
demanded that the \emph{Umgeher} should be exiled from their kingdom. Out of
fear of upsetting their population any further, house \emph{de\'Var} gave the
\emph{Umgeher} the gift of reproduction and exiled them from the city. The
exile was lifted in \emph{MI:1100}.

\subsubsection*{House Liares}

The high elven house \emph{Liares} rules the territories on the shores and
main land of \emph{Eilean Mor}. Although they are the smallest house of
nobility in Helmarnock, they are one of the most important. They own the
vast majority of farms on the mainland and are vitally important both to
provide and produce the food for the islands, as well as for growing the
roots and herbs required to brew \emph{Ramesk}, the blood substitution drink
for the vampires. House \emph{Liares} are also responsible for maintaining
good relations with the other city kingdoms, and thus run embassies and
provide ambassadors.
