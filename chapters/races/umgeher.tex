\graham{The less shared about this experience the better.}

\emph{Umgeher} are undead humanoids that retain their own individuality,
will and determination across the process that turned them into undead. They
were created by the ancient vampires that reign in the city kingdom of
\emph{Helmarnock} centuries ago, and were given the freedom to reproduce.
Soon they travelled and spread across the entire known world. Although they
are immortal, they are not invincible. More so, their flesh and skin is in a
constant state of decay, and must combat their never ending dissolution with
oils and ointment. They have no bodily hair, and often wear wigs to blend into
normal population.

\emph{Umgeher}, like any species, are free to determine their own fates and
shape their own destinies, they do have to constantly combat the ignorance and
fear of the other races. Many religious institutions and city states have now
allowed \emph{umgeher} to live there without a fear of being persecuted.
However this is a recent trend, and \emph{umgeher} prefer to build their own
little communities, towns and sometimes even small cities.
