\graham{The less shared about this experience the better.}

\emph{Umgeher} (old Teranim for someone who walks again) are undead humanoids
that retained their own individuality, will, memories and determination across
the process that turned them into undead. They were created centuries ago by
the ancient vampires that reign in the city kingdom of \nameref{sec:Helmarnock},
and were given the freedom to reproduce on their own.

This allowed them to establish themselves as their own species on Aror, and
thus soon travelled and spread across the entire known world. Although they
are immortal, they are not invincible. Umgeher do not require food or sleep,
but must drink water to survive. More so, their flesh and skin is in a
constant state of decay, and must combat their never ending dissolution with
oils and ointment. They have no bodily hair, and often wear wigs to blend into
normal population.

Umgeher, like any species, are free to determine their own fates and shape
their own destinies. They do have to constantly combat the ignorance and fear
of the other races. Some city states have now allowed umgeher to become full
citizens, and treat them equal to any humanoid race. This was a recent trend
however, and most umgeher prefer to build their own little communities and
towns in more rural areas.

Many religious institutions that see necromancy and undead as a defilement of
life, also persecute, hunt and destroy umgeher. Those institutions are also
to blame for the many lies that have spread across the general populace about
umgeher, such as their fanatical cravings about humanoid flesh, or that they
will take over heavy labour sectors in an economy.
