\subsection{Gnomes}
\label{sec:Gnomes}

\emph{Gnomes} are the children of \emph{halflings} and \emph{dwarves}. Since
they have no identity of their own, no culture of their own, they often try to
integrate with their parents' cultures. Albeit they rarely fit in with either
societies. Gnomes themselves are sterile, and thus rarely create their own
families, they have inherit the longevity of their dwarven parent. All in
all \emph{gnomes} are among the rarest races on \emph{Aror}. They often
dedicate their lives to adventuring and other dangerous businesses, and rarely
settle down.

There are no \emph{gnome} settlements or even kingdoms, and most of them live
scattered across the world in the large city kingdoms. Offering their services
as spies, thieves and adventurers to anyone willing to pay. Most large dwarven
cities and halfling settlements also have a small \emph{gnome} population.

    carrying limits are three-quarters of those of a Medium character.

    \item Low-Light Vision: A gnome can see twice as far as a human in
    starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of poor

    these conditions.
