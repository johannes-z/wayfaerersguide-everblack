\subsection{Týnríkke}
\label{sec:Tynrikke}

The \emph{Týnríkke} (Ancient Teranim for the ``forgotten kingdom''), often
shortened to simply ``tyn'', is a large tribe of giant humanoids that live in
the north western part of \nameref{Eilean Mor}, and all over
\nameref{sec:Iafandir}.

Their outward appearance is very similar to humans, but their average size
ranges between 2.5 to 3 metres. Although most other races call them giants
because of their sheer size, they are closer to the core humanoid races, than
to the actual giants and giant races of \hyperref{sec:Aror}{Aror}. The tyn
have grey-blue skin, green or blue eyes, often blond or light brown hair.
Much like the other humanoid races, the male tyn can grow facial hair.

It is unclear how they are related to the core humanoid races, but due to the
fact that they speak ancient Teranim, and their similarities to the humans,
scholars agree that the tyn and humanoids must share a common ancestors.
