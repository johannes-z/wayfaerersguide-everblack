\subsection{Halflings}
\label{sec:Halflings}

Halflings are small, often barely reaching one metre. What they lack in
strength and constitution, they make up dexterity and curiosity.

Most of the halflings are nomads, who travel across the lands in search for
places to explore and discover. If you think you have found a secluded spot on
\emph{Aror}, where no one else had sat foot before, you can be sure it is
already named after an halfling explorer. They travel in small families, and
in exchange for money or lodging, they offer their services to any small town
they come across on their travels. Halflings are curious, adventurous and
often find themselves exploring the depths and other inhospitable places of
\emph{Aror}.

A huge group of halfling families once decided to start another adventure:
their own kingdom. They settled down near an elven kingdom and named their new
kingdom \emph{Br√®agha Hilith}. After decades of peaceful coexistence between
the two races, they finally decided to tear down the last barriers and simply
merge the two kingdoms into a new one: \nameref{sec:Nen-Hilith}. It became a
shining beacon of civilisation, artistry and stability under the known city
kingdoms of \emph{Aror}.
