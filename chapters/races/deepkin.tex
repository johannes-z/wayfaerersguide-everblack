\subsection{Deepkin}
\label{sec:Deepkin}

\aren{I had the misfortune of seeing my people's decline with my own eyes.
I was powerless, and unable to stop it. We are but a shadow of our former
selves...}

\graham{But still you live. And once the time is right, you may reclaim what
once was.}

The \emph{deepkin} are the cavern dwelling cousins of humans. They are capable
of seeing in the dark, are however colour blind, and often have white pale
skin, red to brownish hair, and either red, green, blue or yellow eyes.

\emph{Deepkin} society is one of the older societies on \emph{Aror}, with a
long standing history in the arcane arts, building magnificent underground
cities, libraries and workshops. Ancient \emph{deepkin} were master arcane
smiths, golem constructors, inventor of many magic based constructs and
technology still used today.

The ancient deepkin had their dominance challenged by the other races
of the deep, namely the dwarves, dark elves, and a now extinct species called
the \emph{ilians}. Thousand of years of conflicts lead to the decline of their
magnificent ancient civilisation. Instead of perishing however, they fled to
the surface, where they were warmly received by their surface cousins. Nowadays
\emph{deepkin} culture is but a shadow of what it was, although they still try
to reclaim what was once theirs with expeditions into the deep.  Albeit they
were well known city and kingdom builders, only one deepkin settlement rose to
the rank of a formidable city kingdom: \emph{Stenheim}.

Although \emph{deepkin} are treated as their own race, they are still capable
of producing viable offspring with normal humans. The race of the offspring is
always that of the mother.
