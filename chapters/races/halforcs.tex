\subsection{Half-Orcs}
\label{sec:Half-Orcs}

Less rare than \emph{Gnomes}, but equally outcasts in most places, are the
offspring of the union of human, deepkin or elf with an orc. Much like other
half breed races \emph{half-orcs} are sterile, and thus have no inner need or
desire to settle down or start families. They often live amongst their human
parents offering their brute strength and enduring physique as heavy labourers
or fighters. A human mother giving birth to a \emph{half-orc} has a high
chance of dying during child birth. And since very few women take such a risk,
many \emph{half-orc} children are not the result of a voluntary union. This
sad reality, combined with a short temper, less than flattering appearance and
low living status and conditions, often elicit condescending or outright
demeaning behaviour from the other races towards \emph{half-orcs}.

\begin{35e}{Half-Orc Traits}
  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item Their orcish blood makes it easier for half-orcs to gain muscle mass
      and thus have +2 racial bonus to Strength.
    \item Medium: As Medium creatures, half-orcs have no special bonuses or
      penalties due to their size.
    \item Half-orc base land speed is 30 feet.
    \item Orc Blood: For all effects related to race, a half-orc is considered
    an orc.
    \item Automatic Languages: Teranim, Orc. Bonus Languages: Any (except secret
      languages)
    \item Favoured Class: Any. When determining whether a multi class takes an
    experience point penalty, his or her highest-level class does not count.
  \end{itemize}
