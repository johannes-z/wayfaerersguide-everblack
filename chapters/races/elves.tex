\subsection{Elves}
\label{sec:Elves}

Elves are tall - often between 1.90 and 2.40 metres - and slender race, with
long and pointy ears. The style of the elven ears varies, with some having
smaller pointy ears facing backwards, while others have longer and sharper
ears that follows the contours of their face. The variety within the elven
ears is vast, but is but a minor cosmetic difference. Their physique and build
is slender as well, with long skinny legs and arms. Elves live up to 400 years
of age, and thus often pick up professions that take longer to master, such as
wizardry, artistry or the sciences. Although elves live long, they often shift
focus in their goals. Apart from the humans, the elves are one of the older
races of \emph{Aror}.

Unlike humans, elves do have distinct sub races that differ from each other in
various physical and biological aspects. The \emph{snow elves} for example
have a natural resistance to cold like no other species have, while the
\emph{dark elves} have adapted to see better in the dark caverns they
inhabit. However they have not diverged so far from one another to not produce
vialable offspring. As with humans and deepkin the race of the sibling always
resembles that of the mother.

There are five major elven races that are recognised across the world of
\emph{Everblack}:

\subsubsection*{High Elves}
\label{sec:High Elves}

The most numerous are the high elves of \emph{Avenfjord}. High elves have
fair skin with a hint of yellow and gold. Their hair ranges from blond, fiery
red and black. High elves are the most adaptable and curious of the
elves, and often live within human city kingdoms, adapting and integrating
well with other cultures and societies. Even though they have their own
kingdom, the vast majority of high elves live outside the kingdom
of \emph{Avenfjord}. High elves were the only civilised elven race for
quite a while, and often have a long standing history living together with
their distant human cousins within baronies, kingdoms and city states.

High Elves speak \emph{Enro'ad}, a variant of \emph{Old Teranim}, but use the
halfling alphabet called \emph{Taavid} to write it.

\begin{35e}{High Elf Traits}
  \emph{Enro'ad} is elvish, albeit the elven alphabet is now written with
  the \emph{halfling} script.

  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item Medium: As Medium creatures, elves have no special bonuses or
    penalties due to their size.
    \item Low-Light Vision: An elf see twice as far as a human in starlight,
    moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of poor illumination. She
    retains the ability to distinguish colour and detail under these
    conditions.
    \item Elvish adulthood lasts longer than in other species, and they thus
      have more time to learn while they grow up. This grants them a + 2
      racial bonus to intelligence, and elves can select one extra
      \hyperref[sec:Education Feats]{education feat} at level 1.
    \item Automatic languages: Enro'ad, Teranim. Bonus Languages: Any (except
      secret languages)
    \item Favoured Class: Any. When determining whether a multi class takes an
    experience point penalty, his or her highest-level class does not count.
  \end{itemize}
\end{35e}

\subsubsection*{Dark Elves}
\label{sec:Dark Elves}

The \emph{dark elves} live underground, have black to blue skin, and their
hair ranges from a faint hint of blue, silver to snow white. Their eyes are
often red, blue or a bright yellow. They are the smallest of all elven races,
and range from 1.70 to 1.90 metres in height. In terms of bodily physique
they also more closely resemble humans, rather than their high elven cousins.

They are often live primitive, nomadic lives underground, adapted to the harsh
realities of the depths below. They have survived the harsh conditions of the
deep caverns by remaining on the move or by hiding from threats. They value
their small communities and family above all else. Many dark elves also live
on the surface, and much like their surface cousins, they blend in well with
human societies very easily.

Dark elves are no kingdom builders and instead wish to emulate their fair
skinned brethren that have managed to integrate well into human kingdoms. Their
strong loyalty to their community makes them a welcomed member of any smaller
towns and villages they join.

\begin{35e}{Dark Elf Traits}
  \textbf{Dark Elf Traits (Ex)}: The following traits are in \emph{addition}
  to the high elf traits, except when noted.
  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item Dark elves are considered smaller and more nimble than the other
      elven races, and thus gain a +2 racial bonus to dexterity.
    \item Dark vision out to 120 feet, albeit they are colour blind.
    \item Automatic languages: Doresh, Enro'ad, Teranim. Bonus Languages: Any
      (except secret languages)
  \end{itemize}
\end{35e}

\subsubsection*{Snow Elves}
\label{sec:Snow Elves}

\aren{Snow Elves are the pinnacle of beauty...}

Far to the north and south live the \emph{snow elves}, nomadic hunter-gatherer
elves with white to silver blue skin, white or blue hair, and bright blue,
green or yellow eyes. Male snow elves are capable of growing facial hair. Snow
elves are as tall as their high elven brethren, ranging from 1.8 to 2.3. They
have adapted well to the colder climates, and are expert hunters and weapon
smiths. Many \emph{snow elves} live in smaller families and tribes, content
with surviving the harsh realities of the polar north and south by becoming
fierce hunters or even raiders themselves. Along with the
\emph{wood elves}, they are rather rare in human societies.

Snow elves are generally known to be calm, and quiet, preferring the solitude
of a small group or town over the vast stretches of cities. They rarely leave
the frozen north and south, and are thus exotic, as in, not many other
humanoids have seen a snow elf in person.

They do not build city or kingdoms, and prefer to live in small tribes and
villages in frozen north and south. Snow elves rarely leave their icy domain,
and most ancestors of the snow elves in the city kingdoms were raided,
captured and brought there as slaves. Those civilised snow elves do not
harbour any animosity any more about what happened to their ancestors, and
prefer to remain in the places and cultures they know call their home.

\begin{35e}{Snow Elf Traits}
  \textbf{Snow Elf Traits (Ex)}: The following traits are in \emph{addition}
  to the high elf traits, except when noted.
  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item \textbf{Pale Wastes (Su)}: A pale elf can live comfortably in
      conditions of extreme cold, even with barely any clothing or external
      sources of warmth. This ability functions like a continuous \emph{Endure
      Elements} but for cold conditions only.
    \item Snow elves are known for their inherent ability to perceive hidden
      and small details, and thus have a +2 racial bonus to wisdom.
    \item Automatic languages: Enro'ad, Teranim. Bonus Languages: Any (except
      secret languages)
  \end{itemize}
\end{35e}

\subsubsection*{Wood Elves}
\label{sec:Wood Elves}

Wood elves have light brown skin, green or red hair. Their faces are often
covered in light or red freckles, and their eyes are often brown, blue or
green. They are as tall as their high elven counter parts, often ranging from
2 metres to 2 metres 40. Although they are only superficially different from
their high elven cousins, they are counted as their own race based on their
different culture in the areas they have settled. Even though they are known
to join the major city kingdoms, they are rarer than high elves, dark elves or
snow elves.

There are two major tribes of wood elves. The first lives in the vast
temperate boreal forest of \emph{Eilean Mor}, known as the \emph{Dirgewood}.
These wood elves live together with humans, halflings of the Dirgewood, as
well as the dark elves, deepkin and the dwarves of the \emph{Great Divide}.
They are followers of the \emph{old ways}, and prefer to build small
settlements, towns and perhaps tiny cities of their own. These wood elves are
expert trackers, farmers, as well as druids and priests of the old ways.

And in the jungles \emph{Yua'cata} live the \emph{savage elves}, a loose
collection of tribes of cannibalistic and demon worshipping wood elves. They
rarely wander beyond the confines of their jungle and are one of the rarest
elves to meet in the civilised areas of \emph{Aror}. They live a primitive
life, adapted to the harsh environment in the depths of the rain forest.

\begin{35e}{Woold Elf Traits}
  \textbf{Wood Elf Traits (Ex)}: The following traits are in \emph{addition}
  to the high elf traits, except when noted.
  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item Wood elves have it easier to gain muscle mass than the other elvish
      races, and thus have a +2 racial bonus to strength.
    \item Automatic languages: Enro'ad. Bonus Languages: Any (except secret
      languages)
  \end{itemize}
\end{35e}
