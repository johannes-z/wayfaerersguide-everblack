\subsection{Half-Elves}
\label{sec:Half-Elves}

The union of human and elf was possible in the past, but since then the elves
and humans diverted too far apart to produce viable offspring. Most children
that are now born in the union between elf and men are often born with birth
defects, with severe mental disability, if they - and the mothers giving
birth - survive birth at all.

This was not always the case however, and tens of thousands of years ago the
union was possible. It produced a sizeable amount of half elves back then,
which over the course of the recent history struggled to keep their populace
alive and growing. Constant inter-family marriages over the course of
thousands of years have created a tight-knit clan of half elves that span the
globe. Although they form no kingdoms of their own, they have created a
secondary culture that focuses heavily on the continuation of their
people. Half-elf lore keepers keep meticulous record of what half-elven family
lives where, and with whom they are related. Half-elves are encouraged to
marry within their own species, as introducing either elven or human blood
would ``weaken'' the half-elf population.
