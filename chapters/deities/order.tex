\subsection{The Order Above Chaos}
\label{sec:Order}

The \emph{Order Above Chaos} or simply the \emph{Order} is a true deity, that
represents order and justice, regardless of prevailing law. It is seen as the
\emph{higher order of all things} intrinsic and true to all societies. The
fundamental laws and rules that govern all species, from which no one can
escape, and that which thrones above everyone and everything, even kings.

\subsubsection{Personification}

The Order is often depicted as a council of hooded humanoid creatures engaged
in a debate or council. More often than not the Order is not personified at
all, and instead represented by a dagger pointing downward to form a cross.

\subsubsection{Prevailing Dogma}

The \emph{Order Above Chaos} has two major churches and dogmas: The
\nameref{sec:Four Holy Orders}, and the \nameref{sec:Holy Order of Aleaste}.
Both follow the same basic tenets of the Order Above Chaos, but differ
substantially in the amount they are allowed to interfere in local affairs.

\subsubsection{Rivalry with Lor}

The followers of the Order are in direct conflict with the followers of the
lesser deity of \emph{Lor}. Their argument is that the entity known as
\emph{Lor} represents chaos disguised as a just crusade, and does nothing to
maintain the order of things in the long term. In return the followers of
\emph{Lor} accuse the followers of the Order to indulge in vengeance instead
of seeking true and fair justice.

  The \emph{Order Above Chaos} is considered Lawful Neutral, and their favoured
  weapon is the dagger.
