\subsection{Silent Queen}
\label{sec:Silent Queen}

The \emph{Silent Queen} was a powerful lesser deity of the night, shadows,
theft, magic and subterfuge, until she was killed by her high priestess
\nameref{sec:Aria} in \emph{MI:0}. She was often depicted as a hooded woman who
had her mouth sewn shut.

\subsubsection{History}

She was once the patron of all people that worked in the shadows, such as
thieves, spies, smugglers and assassins, and those that practised their
forbidden arcane arts in secrets such as necromancers. She was never openly
worshipped, but did find a few large congregations among the ancient
\hyperref[sec:Dark Elves]{dark elves} and \hyperref[sec:Deepkin]{deepkin}.

\subsubsection{Holy Crusade}

As the goddess of night she was always the opposite of \nameref{sec:Griannar},
and the two religions often clashed in violent disputes and skirmishes. These
clashes escalated to a full fledged war, which the followers of Griannar simply
called the \nameref{sec:Holy Crusade}. Although the queen emerged victories
from the war, she was ultimately slain and usurped by her then high priestess
\nameref{sec:Aria}.

\subsubsection{Worship}

Not much is known about her worship any more, since the followers of Aria are
actively engaged in hoarding and destroying any knowledge of the Queen's
teachings and religious practises. Especially the \nameref{sec:Well of Truth}
is actively hunting and collecting ancient tomes of the Queen, but it is
unknown whether the tomes are kept or destroyed.

Although knowledge of her existence is widespread among scholars, she has
drifted into obscurity amidst the general populace. Her rites, teachings
and knowledge is all but lost. All that remains of her are the occasional
statues in honour of the Silent Queen in the caverns of the deep.

  She was considered \emph{chaotic evil}, but since her death, her follower
  and priests no longer receive divine power.
