\subsection{Old Ways}

The \emph{Old Ways} are not a god or deity, but instead a set of believes,
traditions, and stories that represent how the ancient humanoids worshipped
the three major deities of Aror.

\subsubsection*{Three Mothers}

The core of the religion are three female deities that are worshipped as the
three mothers of all humanoid races. Each of them represents one stage of
a woman's development. \emph{Forun} represents the young, hopeful, and
beautiful woman that raises her children with warmth, compassion and love. She
represents youth, beauty, fire and fertility. \emph{Marwaid} represents the
ageing mother, that has lost children, and sacrificed everything that she has
for her young. She is seen as the hardened, stern and often embittered woman
that raises her children to withstand the harsh realities of life.
\emph{Nyddwr} represents the old woman, a crone, that offers her immense
wisdom to aid her already fully grown children. She represents the tempered,
wise, yet hardy old woman that survived against all odds, and now shares her
wisdom with others.

\subsubsection*{Stories}

\graham{I always had nightmares of being told ``The Eyeless Man of the Cave''
  by my mother.}

\aren{We had the same story, but called it ``The Lone Ilian''. The stories of
  the Old Ways survive in many cultures, and will continue to scar and
  traumatise children for centuries to come.}

Another important part of the Old Ways are the stories. A collection of mystic
stories, parables, and myths that are passed orally from one generation to the
other. They often have several purposes, but most stories are told to children
to explain to them the dangers, beauties, and also the horror stories of the
world. The collection of all these stories and myths is called the
\emph{old prose}.

The stories also contain heroic accounts of heroes of old. Bold tales about
people that ventured forth to slay beasts, save the innocent, become kings, or
return a powerful magical artefact back to save the village from certain doom.
But the stories also contain horror stories that end badly, such as the new
mother that goes to the woods only to be eaten by a werewolf before her
husband can save her.

The most important part of these stories however is to teach the core values of
the Old Ways. The most important being dedication, loyalty and honour to your
own clan or tribe. Each member of a clan should give what he can, and take as
little as he requires. This not only extends to love, life, family but also
to nature, with which every follower of the Old Ways must strive to respect.

\subsubsection*{Incantations}

The Old Ways do not have priests per se, but instead the \emph{old prose} also
contains incantations that may be cast by anyone versed well enough in the
old stories. These incantations are divine magic, and quite powerful. However
they often require hours of preparations, several people, complicated chats in
\emph{Ancient Teranim}, and sometimes even live sacrifices to the three
mothers to succeed. Practised witches and witchers of the old ways are often
the spiritual centre of a clan or community, and tasked to gather, teach and
perform these old incantations when required.
