\section*{City Kingdoms}

The world of \emph{Aror} is covered in a few huge and ancient human kingdoms
that exert their influence and power from vast cities. These cities often house
millions of humanoid creatures, and often the kingdom's influence and power
extended outward to surrounding areas.

All of these city kingdoms are connected together with \emph{dragon
  teleporters}, which allows travel and trade between the kingdoms. They are
often a beacon of stability and security. Surrounded by wild nature, unstable
baronies, and small and greedy earldoms that vie for power and wealth.

Many of these city kingdoms have their own unique culture, local language
dialects, their own laws and customs, and often also unique governments. However
most of these kingdoms are ruled by humans, where other races often take a
secondary role as minorities within the general populace. Still the mixture
of races, backgrounds and various cultures often add a unique touch to the
whole.

In many cases the town or city kingdom you came from defines you more than
your race. A \emph{snow elf} born in \emph{Avenfjord} will have come to grow
up with that cities culture, most likely favouring the arts over the hunting
bow.
