\section*{City Kingdoms}

The world of \emph{Aror} is covered in a few huge and ancient human kingdoms
that exert their influence and power from vast cities. These cities often house
millions of humanoid creatures, and often the kingdom's influence and power
extended outward to surrounding areas.

All of these city kingdoms are connected together with \emph{dragon
  teleporters}, which allows travel and trade between the kingdoms. They are
often a beacon of stability and security. Surrounded by wild nature, unstable
baronies, and small and greedy earldoms that vie for power and wealth.

Many of these city kingdoms have their own unique culture, local language
dialects, their own laws and customs, and often also unique governments. However
most of these kingdoms are ruled by humans, where other races often take a
secondary role as minorities within the general populace. Still the mixture
of races, backgrounds and various cultures often add a unique touch to the
whole.

In many cases the town or city kingdom you came from defines you more than
your race. A \emph{snow elf} born in \emph{Avenfjord} will have come to grow
up with that cities culture, most likely favouring the arts over the hunting
bow.

\subsection*{Forsby}

\aren{You can tell someone hails from Forsby a second after he or she opened
  their mouth.}

The city kingdom of \emph{Forsby} was founded in \emph{GT:10840}, and resides
on the western cliffs of the continent of \emph{Goltir}. It was built upon
white cliffs, with the huge castle residing over the view of the sea. The city
itself was built in the surrounding area up high on the cliffs, as well as
into the cliff itself. \emph{Forsby} harbour, a huge trading and commerce
district is built beneath the cliff into the water. The way up the cliffs now
houses shops, taverns and another commercial district. But \emph{Forsby} also
has a darker and secretive side. Beneath the main castle and noble district
high up the cliffs lies the aqueduct that sends the waste down to the sea. It
is simply referred to as the \emph{pit}. It houses a vast bazaar and underworld,
where everything and everyone can be bought for the right price.

\subsubsection*{Culture}

Although \emph{Forsby} has a long standing tradition of chivalry and nobility,
the general population is well aware of the hypocrisy by not moving against the
\emph{pit}. The average citizen is nevertheless proud of the ancient history of
the city, it's wealth and that a long line of just kings and queens have lead
the kingdom to become one the most powerful on the planet. \emph{Forsby} is
known for its arcane academy, which has produced many fine and outstanding
wizards; as well as for its public schools that teach any children within the
city and kingdom.

The people of \emph{Forsby} are known as stubborn, determined but hard working
to achieve their goals. They are well recognised by their rather cryptic dialect
of the common language called \emph{Reatham}. The city itself is open to every
race, and so are its people.

The most worshipped religions of \emph{Forsby} are \emph{Lor}, \emph{Forun}
but also \emph{Aria} with the less noble elements that work and live in the
\emph{pit}.

\subsubsection*{Nobility}

The city kingdom of \emph{Forsby} has a long standing tradition of noble
families that have been in charge of the cities affairs for several thousand
years. Their names carry weight even outside the borders of the city, and
they are well established in other city kingdoms across the globe.

The three major families are \emph{Ban√©r}, \emph{Liljenar} and \emph{Lorham}
who have, in turn, ruled the city since its foundation. These three houses
have been known to feud and fight amongst each other, yet still they share
one common goal: the survival and prosperity of the kingdom. While these
three vie for the throne all of the time, there are several smaller houses
of nobility that control smaller aspects of the city: House \emph{Forholm}
runs the cities trading company and shipping docks, and have been known to
do business with the shadier aspects of the \emph{pit}. The House of
\emph{Lemberg} is known to operate most of the kingdom's farms outside of
the city, and are vital to the city's self sustainability in terms of food
and agricultural products.
