\section*{Foreword by Graham Balance}

The following book should serve you well as an introduction to the
place you might only know as the place \emph{where everblack comes
  from}. I, Archmagi Graham Balance, would like you welcome you to
our corner of the multiverse: ``Aror''.

This book will serve you as a guide to Aror's many places, cultures,
customs, people and creatures. I am fortunate to have counted this
place as my home for many years, and it holds a special place in my
heart. Great was the dismay when I had to discover on my frequent
travels and journyes to other planes, that our tiny little speck of
the multiverse was not very well know, or perhaps only known as the
``place where Everblack crystals come from''. While true, it saddens
me deeply to see our fine planet, and its people, reduced to the mere
fact that we export black crystals charged with arcane energy. That
experience was the sole motivator on why I am wrote this book: To bring
our way of life to you, dear reader.

I have interviewed many that did come to Aror, and most of them only
remembered the bad things that had happened to them in their short
visit: unfriendly locals speaking weird tongues, stale ale, and the
occasional blind subterranean humanoid that tried to eat them. While
many of these aspects are true, they are warped exaggerations of the
truth. My sincere hopes are that, after reading through this book, you
have arrived at the conclusion that Aror is a place worth visiting,
that our ale is as good as any - if not better - and that the
cannibalistic blind humanoid creatures of the deep are too far and few
between to be a real threat.

You will have heard our most treasured places, such as the holy lake
of \emph{Mu'ut} in the south; the lone yet towering \emph{Goban}
mountain in the east; the endless treasures, archipelagos and beaches
that the \emph{Silver Isles} have to offer; or the vast mountains,
lush forests, and friendly locals of \emph{Eilean Mor}. If that does
not impress you, I am sure the grandious library and arcane college of
\emph{Fes el-Bali}, the towering cliff side castle of \emph{Forsby} or
the endless riches in art and music of \emph{Nen-Hilith} surely will
make a lasting impression.

\section*{Additional Foreword by Aren Fel}

My good old friend Graham is right in one aspect: Aror has an insidious
way of sneaking into your heart, embedding itself so deeply that not
even a Dryad could convince the roots to leave you. But he is wrong in
so many other things. The ale has not gotten better, and the people
are still unfriendly. But much has changed since the almost 4000 years
this book was originally published. Gods have vanished, civilisations
have fallen, generations have been born and have died; and most important
of all - cultures, languages and entire epochs have been lost only to be
rediscovered centuries later.

I, Aren Fel, have done my best to adapt, change and translate the
book, so that the work of my good friend continues as he originally
intended: as an useful guide to our world, both past and present. In
many ways the book has now exceeded it's original purpose. It was once
a mere introduction to Aror, but it is now also a chronicle of our
history. A lens into our past, and perhaps a warning for our future.

Be safe adventurer, and fasten this book to your belt for easy access,
in case any blind cannibalistic humanoids chase you throw a cavern.
