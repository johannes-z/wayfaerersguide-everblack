\subsection{Food, Drink, And Lodging}
\label{sec:Food}

Food, drink and lodging is offered in most towns and even small hamlets by
the local inn. One can expect to find inns and taverns almost everywhere on
Aror, where most of them cater to a specific demographic. It is not uncommon
to find slave only taverns, as well as taverns where slaves or even monstrous
races are forbidden from entering.

Most inns serve what is called a never-ending stew, a broth that has been
cooking for several weeks, if not months and is replenished in the morning
with fresh ingredients. It is served with bread and watered ale. Most inns
also serve a cold platter of dried meat, bread and cheese. While the southern
regions and \nameref{sec:Forsby} has a long tradition in making and enjoying
tea, while the northern regions prefer coffee. Coffee culture, with lots of
small coffee shops that also serve food and snacks are popular especially
in \nameref{sec:Hraglund}.

Slaves that are not regularly feed by their owners often make their own
secret taverns and inns. These then serve food scraps, water and other low
quality food for free to other slaves. Although these inns and taverns are
often illegal, they are more often than not tolerated and sometimes even
receive food from priests and temples that seek to do good.

A common low quality slave food is a white thickish paste made out of nuts,
roots, fat and law quality meat such as rat or pigeon. It is eaten with
stale or old bread, and has many different names such as ``bird butter'',
or ``dead man's shoe''.

\subsection{Slaves}
\label{sec:Slave Prices}

The prices for slaves varies largely per region. They are most expensive in
regions that do not actively engage in slavery on a massive scale, and are
generally cheaper in the slaving nations. Basic prices for slaves start at
around 50 shards, and then increase or decreased based on economy and
condition of the slave.

Most slaves are bought for menial labour, so healthy and capable workers are
the most common type of slave being sold. Slaves that are wounded, sick, or
otherwise usually cost less, while exotic and specially trained slaves cost
more.

\subsection{Transport}
\label{sec:Transport}

There are a wide variety of different modes of transportation available on
Aror. All large city kingdoms are situated near the sea, and thus have large
ports and shipping enterprises that ferry people and goods all over the
world. Transportation over land is largely done through horses and carriages.

Ever since \hyperref[sec:Dragon Teleporter]{dragon teleporters} were installed
to connect most major city kingdoms with each other, travelling became cheaper
and easier. A ticket for a dragon teleporter costs between \textbf{15 and 20
  shins}.
