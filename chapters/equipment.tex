\subsection{Slaves}
\label{sec:Slave Prices}

The prices for slaves varies largely per region. They are most expensive in
regions that do not actively engage in slavery on a massive scale, and are
generally cheaper in the slaving nations. Basic prices for slaves start at
around 50 shards, and then increase or decreased based on economy and
condition of the slave.

Most slaves are bought for menial labour, so healthy and capable workers are
the most common type of slave being sold. Slaves that are wounded, sick, or
otherwise usually cost less, while exotic and specially trained slaves cost
more.

\subsection{Transport}
\label{sec:Transport}

There are a wide variety of different modes of transportation available on
Aror. All large city kingdoms are situated near the sea, and thus have large
ports and shipping enterprises that ferry people and goods all over the
world. Transportation over land is largely done through horses and carriages.

Ever since \hyperref[sec:Dragon Teleporter]{dragon teleporters} were installed
to connect most major city kingdoms with each other, travelling became cheaper
and easier. A ticket for a dragon teleporter costs between \textbf{15 and 20
  shins}.
