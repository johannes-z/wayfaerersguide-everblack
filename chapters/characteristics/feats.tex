\subsection{Feats}

Everblack introduces two new feat types: \emph{heritage feats} and
\emph{education feats}. Only one of each can be taken per character, and only
at level one. However these feats do not count towards your maximum amount of
feats you can take at the first level. Some exceptions exist that grant you
additional \emph{heritage} or \emph{education} feats.

Heritage feats represent what you have learned in the area, society and
culture you up in as a child or teenager. This of course often means that you
must have stayed in one place for a longer period of time. It represents both
your early childhood, your younger years, as well as any particular skills or
habits you might have picked up due to your heritage.

Education feats on the other hand represents what you were trying to learn,
or have learned, before becoming an adventurer. It is not uncommon for young
people to pick up and learn a trade, join a religious order, go to school,
or even join a criminal organisation before they embark on their life of
adventure.
