\subsection{Feats}
\label{sec:Feats}

Everblack introduces two new feat types: \emph{heritage feats} and
\emph{education feats}. Only one of each can be taken per character, and only
at level one. However these feats do not count towards your maximum amount of
feats you can take at the first level. Some exceptions exist that grant you
additional \emph{heritage} or \emph{education} feats.

Heritage feats represent what you have learned in the area, society and
culture you grew up in as a child and teenager. This of course often means that
you must have stayed in one place for a longer period of time. It represents
both your early childhood, your younger years, as well as any particular
skills or habits you might have picked up due to your place of origin.

Education feats on the other hand represent what you were trying to learn,
or have learned, before becoming an adventurer. It is not uncommon for young
people to pick up and learn a trade, join a religious order, go to school,
or even join a criminal organisation before they embark on their life of
adventure.

The knowledge gained by heritage and education feats represent years of
training, studying or lived experience. These feats do not increase the age of
your character, as many educations can be done in the early teenage years of
your character.
