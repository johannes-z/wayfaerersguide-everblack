\section{Races}

The people of Aror make up a multi flavoured stew of various races and
backgrounds. Apart from may races that you might already know from your
home world, such as humans, elves, dwarves or gnomes; Aror is also home to some
you might have never heard of before. Two of these are the \emph{deepkin}, the
\emph{diarim} and the \emph{umgeher}.

You will find that race matters little. An elf of \emph{Norbury} often shares
the warrior culture, and faith in the meritocratic societal ideas
of \emph{Norbury}. While a dwarf of \emph{Nen-Hilith} will be accustomed and
to the artistic culture and creative ways of the artisans and performers of
that city.

The union of non-humanoid races with humanoid races is something that does
not exist in \emph{Everblack}. Although you might have met ``dragonborn''
(the unity of a human and a dragon) in other realms, you will not find them
on Everblack. And if you do, they are probably extra-planar visitors much
like yourself.

These sections enhance or change the existing core races of D\&D. Any lore you
find in the base books that does not interfere with what is written here, still
holds true.

\subsection{Early History}

Roughly sixty thousand years ago an ice age covered most of the world
of \emph{Aror} in vast sheets of ice and snow. Continents that were separated
by sea, where now suddenly accessible through thick sheets of ice. This
allowed the four core humanoid races, the humans, elves, dwarves and halflings
to settle the entire known world. It is still unclear where they originated
from exactly, but the common scientific consensus is that these races trace
their origins back to the lush rainforests, steppes and savannah
of \emph{Arania}.

\subsubsection{Aeon of Strife}
\label{sec:Aeon of Strife}

When the humanoid races arrived in the other continents they found that they
were already inhabited by sentient races. Ogres, minotaurs, trolls, fey,
hobgoblins, gnolls, bugbears already called these continents their home,
alongside non-sentient monstrous species such as hydras, manticores and
wyverns. Through ancient stories of the dwarves, early writings, ancient stone
tablets and even cave paintings, it was revealed that the humanoid ancestors
were in a constant state of conflict with these monstrous races. Wars,
skirmishes, and often the destruction of entire early villages and even cities
was a common occurrence in early history. This early time of constant fighting,
turmoil and wars against the sentient beast races is referred to as the
\emph{aeon of strife}.

The aeon saw the birth of many new races, such as
\hyperref[sec:Vampires]{vampires}, \hyperref[sec:Fey]{fey} and
\hyperref[sec:Lycanthropes]{lycanthropes}. It also saw a vast destruction of
nature, as both sides of the war cut down forests, dried swamps, and forever
corrupted landscapes and areas with dark and foul magic.

Even though the aeon of strife is now thousands years past, it is still
vividly remembered in both humanoid and monstrous cultures through stories,
song, and tradition.

\subsubsection{Schism}
\label{sec:Schism}

The ultimately successful survival strategy to deal with such a hostile
environment during the strife ingrained itself in the culture of the core
humanoid races. The dwarves went underground and organised themselves in
strict hierarchical clans and cities that allowed them to optimise their
societies to the harsh realities and lack of resources of the depths. Some
humans and elves followed the dwarves underground but ultimately failed to
replicate the dwarven's success (with a few notable exceptions). Although
the \emph{deepkin} - the underground dwelling cousins of the humans - built
large civilisations underground they were ultimately defeated by the sentient
races of the depths and driven to the surface. The dark elves instead relied
on small clans, families and by being constantly on the move to ensure the
survival of their species.

Meanwhile on the surface elves and halflings sought to settle as far away from
the monstrous races as possible, leading them to the continent of \emph{South
Goltir} and \emph{Farlar}, as well as becoming the pale elves by settling the
vast ice sheets of the north and south poles. Humans on the other hand used
their ingenuity and skill to build great civilisations and cities that could
potentially withstand the skirmishes and sieges of the sentient monstrous
races. Through many iterations over the course of thousands of years, which
resulted in countless destroyed and ransacked cities and fallen civilisations,
humans have now achieved the unthinkable: dethrone the monstrous races as the
predominant species across all of Aror.

\subsubsection{Exodus from the Depths}
\label{sec:Exodus from the Depths}

Now many elves and halflings have joined the human effort of building large
centres of civilisation, enriching the predominantly human city kingdoms that
dot the world of \emph{Aror}. Their struggle against the sentient monstrous
races is far from over, especially in the central regions of the continents,
or from the still predominantly monstrous continent of \emph{IÃ¢fandir}. The
majority of dwarves have remained underground, continuing their strict ways of
life as it has served them for centuries. A success that was not shared by the
dark elves and deepkin, who have mostly abandoned the deep and returned to the
surface.
